# Dotfiles and stuff
These are my configs for Arch
I can't use chezmoi so this is a mess.
It's wayland only but you can find old X11 configs on the commit history (spaghetti)

### Basics
*Hyprland*:
- cool rofi config (very poggers)
- waybar with dynamic colors
- hyprland personal config with themes (check before using)
- same nvim and terminal
- firefox auto switches with pywalfox
 **the theme switcher is theme_changer_wl and the keys hyp_bindings (alt + control + k)**
 
 ## Dependencies
 This is not an intensive list but here's a reference
 
 Main setup: 
 - waybar-hyprland-git: Bar (duh)
 - swaync sway idle (notification center and autolocking)
  - gtklock (locker util, I also have playerctl module)
 - hyprshade (bluelight filter + shader manager)
 - playerctl, light (manage sound and brightness)
 - grim, slurp, swappy (screenshottting)
 - rofi-lbonn-wayland (rofi with wayland patch, app picker)
 - dbus, gnome-polkit, wayland, wl-copy and wl-clip-persist (for general wayland stuff)
 - neovim (editor)
 - kitty (terminal emulator)
 - fzf, zsh and zinit (shell)
 - ranger and nemo + nemo-filleroller (file managers)
 - firefox,python-pywalfox, python-pywal (firefox and auto firefox theming)
 - pcloud, bitwarden, kdeconnect (general utils)
 - fcitx5 (input method) 
  
  That should be about it. 
## I think it looks really cool but most of it is stolen so credits to
- ~~https://gitlab.com/brokenbyte/dotfiles/-/tree/master for the some of the nvim configs~~ jokes on you it's now basically all mine now
- ~~https://github.com/lauroro/hyprland-dotfiles (old config)~~ https://github.com/justleoo/dotfiles for most of the waybar config
- https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi for amazing rofi themes
- ~~https://github.com/AmadeusWM/dotfiles-hyprland for the firefox theme~~ pywalfox and a small custom theme, the new tab is still theirs tho
- https://github.com/junnunkarim/dotfiles-linux Most of it was based on him and I still many times take from there
Well not like anyone's gonna read this except but me but that's all folks

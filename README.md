# Dotfiles and stuff
These are my configs for Arch
I can't use chezmoi so this is a mess.
It's wayland only but you can find old X11 configs on the commit history (spaghetti)

### Basics
*Hyprland*:
- cool rofi config (very poggers)
- waybar with dynamic colors
- hyprland personal config with themes (check before using)
- same nvim and terminal
 **the theme switcher is theme_changer_wl and the keys hyp_bindings**
 
 ## Dependencies
 This is not an intensive list but here's a reference
 
 Main setup: `wayland, hyprland-waybar-git, swaync, swaybg, waybar(patch for hyprland, check wiki), libinput-gestures-setup, grim, slur, swappy, wl-copy, rofi-lbonn-wayland, gammmastep, gtklock`
  
Misc applications (many complementary): `dbus, kitty, keepassxc, pcloud, nvim, gnome-polkit, pulseaudio, light, ranger`
  
  That should be about it.
## I think it looks really cool but most of it is stolen so credits to
- ~~https://gitlab.com/brokenbyte/dotfiles/-/tree/master for the some of the nvim configs~~ jokes on you it's now basically all mine now
- ~~https://github.com/lauroro/hyprland-dotfiles (old config)~~ https://github.com/justleoo/dotfiles for most of the waybar config
- https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi for amazing rofi themes
Well not like anyone's gonna read this except but me but that's all folks
